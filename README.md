## 🎯 Project Objectives
This project aims to design and implement a **multi-user secure chat service** using **Java socket programming**.  
The system must evolve through 5 levels of functionality and security:

1. **Level 1:**  
   Develop a multi-user chat server and client using basic sockets (text-based interface).

2. **Level 2:**  
   Implement **SSL/TLS encryption** to ensure message confidentiality over the network.

3. **Level 3:**  
   Identify one additional network security threat and implement a mitigation control  
   (e.g., user authentication, input validation, integrity checking).

4. **Level 4:**  
   Demonstrate the application working across **two physical machines**, configuring firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic.

5. **Level 5:**  
   Capture and analyse network traffic using **Wireshark** to show unencrypted vs encrypted data.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, we will:
- Demonstrate understanding of **socket programming** and **secure communication protocols**.
- Apply **confidentiality, integrity, and authentication** concepts in a practical system.
- Gain experience in configuring **network firewalls** and **analysing traffic** with Wireshark.
- Collaborate effectively on a secure software project from design to testing.
